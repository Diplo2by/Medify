# Medify

An app that stores a person's medical information on blockchain so that medical personnel can access it in an emergency and take appropriate action.
## Case in Point

In India, around 4,72,606 accidents occur each year, with 50 percent of lives saved if competent medical assistance is provided.

This software accomplishes exactly that; in addition to providing medical history, it also informs the patient's relatives. Not only is this software essential for saving lives in an emergency situvation, but it also provides the user with privacy and confidence when sharing his medical records because it is based on blockchain technology.

When a person's medical history is shared with the medical team, the chances of administering the necessary prescription to save lives increase.
